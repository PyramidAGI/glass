set up a landscape of nodes in staggered fashion, like the black squares on a chessboard
each node has a JSON1 and a JSON2
a node uses an algorithm (algo) to process JSON1 into JSON2
each node also uses processes following POJAR, see below
each node has is characterized by orthogonal types: planning type, a controlling type and a causal type
for instance a navigator node = planning type + controlling type + causal type
the navigation node is a node that is used in many situations, but there are also other nodes
information goes down and up through the node landscape

a node uses two loops to interact with other nodes:
Loop1:Belief->Measure
Loop2:Influence->Measure

P O J A R items:
ProblemStory = JSON
Onto = List[String]
Json-target = JSON
Algo = python function
Run = boolean

i want to be able to specify a goal for the total machine 
and then the program should assemble the necessary nodes to achieve this goal
When you run the program, always use the POJAR items for processing each node
